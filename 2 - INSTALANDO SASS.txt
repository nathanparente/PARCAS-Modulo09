LINHAS DE COMANDO: 

When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. 

For example:
sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css

First install Sass using one of the options below, then run sass --version to be sure it installed correctly. 
If it did, this will include 1.50.0. You can also run sass --help for more information about the command-line interface.

Once it's all set up, go and play. If you're brand new to Sass we've set up some resources to help you learn pretty darn quick.

PATH 
The PATH is an important concept when working on the command line. 

It's a list of directories that tell your operating system where to look for programs, 
so that you can just write script instead of /home/me/bin/script or C:\Users\Me\bin\script. 

But different operating systems have different ways to add a new directory to it:

WINDOWS: 
1- The first step depends which version of Windows you're using:
- If you're using Windows 8 or 10, press the Windows key, then search for and select "System (Control Panel)".
- If you're using Windows 7, right click the "Computer" icon on the desktop and click "Properties".

2- Click "Advanced system settings".

3- Click "Environment Variables".

4- Under "System Variables", find the PATH variable, select it, and click "Edit". If there is no PATH variable, click "New".

5- Add your directory to the beginning of the variable value followed by ; (a semicolon). 
- For example, if the value was C:\Windows\System32, change it to C:\Users\Me\bin;C:\Windows\System32.

6- Click "OK".

7- Restart your terminal.
